# renewable_energy

The goal of this project is to create a heatmap of renewable energy power plants and then to show the precentage change in renewable over the 1980's, 1990's,  2000's, and 2010's. 

Four heatmaps were created. One showed all renewable energy plants, the another showed only solar plants, a third showed only hyrdopower plants and the final one showed wind power plants. Solar power is most prevelant in Southern California, the east coast of the United States and parts of Europe. Hyrdopower is most common in Northwestern United States, Canada, Southern Europe, parts of South America and Southeast Asia. Wind power is most prevelant in Midwest United States, Northern Europe and Northern China. 

Of the 3 types of forms of renewable energy looked at hydropower had the least growth, but largest consumption. This may have occurred because there barely was any solar and wind power being generated in the 1980's, so smaller starting number inflates the growth numbers. Peak growth for renewables occured in the period between 2000-2010

The next step would be to look at the period between 2000-2017 in smaller intervals in order to more clearly show the growth rates.

This project uses csv for the locations and growth rates. It uses Google maps to create the heat map. It uses JSON data to map out the outlines of the countrys on the cloropeth maps.
